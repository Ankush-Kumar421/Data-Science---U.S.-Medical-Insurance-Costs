# Data-Science---U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Costs

This project is part of the Codecademy course on data science. In this project, I investigated the medical insurance costs dataset in a `.csv` file using Python. Note that the dataset was from Kaggle.com, which was used in the Codecademy.com platform. 
 The following files are:
1.	U.S Medical Insurance Costs (IPYNB file) – It contains my final analysis. This file contains the code written in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
2.	Insurance (csv file) – It contains the medical insurance costs dataset.
